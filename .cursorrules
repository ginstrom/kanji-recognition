## Development Rules (from @development.md)

### Terminal Output Bug
- There is a bug preventing reading terminal output directly
- When running shell commands, use `tee` to both display and save output to files in /tmp:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up | tee /tmp/docker-compose-out.txt
  ```
- For commands that might produce errors, capture both stdout and stderr:
  ```bash
  docker-compose run --rm handwriting python train.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/train-output.txt
  ```
- **When committing changes to git, use `cat` with various status/diff commands so the entire output is given (e.g., `git status | cat`, `git diff | cat`).**

### Running Code
- Always use docker-compose to run code
- Never run Python scripts directly on the host machine
- Remember that the working directory in the container is `/app/src`, so use script names without the `src/` prefix
- Use `make` commands for common tasks whenever a `Makefile` is available.
- For foreground processes:
  ```bash
  docker-compose run --rm handwriting python train.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/train-output.txt
  ```
- For detached mode (background processes):
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  # Then check logs with:
  docker-compose logs | tee /tmp/docker-logs.txt
  ```
- For interactive sessions:
  ```bash
  docker-compose run --rm handwriting bash
  ```

### Checking Logs
- For containers running in detached mode (-d), use:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs | tee /tmp/docker-logs.txt
  ```
- To follow logs in real-time:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs -f | tee /tmp/docker-logs-live.txt
  ```
- For specific services:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs handwriting | tee /tmp/handwriting-logs.txt
  ```

## Core Principles (from @character-recognition-system.md)
- Provide **concise, technical, and actionable Python examples**.
- Emphasize **clarity, modularity, and efficiency** in model development and data processing.
- Use **object-oriented programming (OOP) for model architectures** and **functional programming for data pipelines and utilities**.
- Follow **PEP 8** style and ensure **descriptive, self-documenting variable and function names**.
- Python modules should have a BRIEF (1-2 line) module-level docstring.
- Leverage **mixed precision training** and **GPU acceleration** wherever applicable.

---

## Deep Learning Best Practices (from @character-recognition-system.md)
- Use **PyTorch** as the primary framework.
- Implement **custom `nn.Module` classes** for convolutional, transformer, or hybrid OCR architectures.
- Use **proper weight initialization** (e.g., He, Xavier) and **BatchNorm/LayerNorm** where appropriate.
- Optimize for **OCR-specific loss functions** (e.g., **CTC loss** or **cross-entropy**), depending on the model output (classification vs. sequence).
- Employ **AdamW or SGD with momentum**, along with **learning rate schedulers**.

---

## Data Handling & Preprocessing (from @character-recognition-system.md)
- Use **PyTorch `Dataset` and `DataLoader`** with **efficient image preprocessing pipelines** (e.g., resizing, normalization, augmentation).
- Implement **custom transforms for handwritten data**, including affine transforms, noise injection, and stroke perturbation.
- Ensure **proper handling of multi-class Japanese characters (Kanji, Hiragana, Katakana)** and correct label encoding.
- Use **train/validation/test splits with stratification if applicable**.
- Include **data sanity checks and visualization tools** for dataset verification.

---

## Model Architectures (from @character-recognition-system.md)
- Explore **CNN-based models (ResNet, EfficientNet)**, **transformer-based models (ViT, Swin Transformer)**, or **hybrids (CNN + Transformer encoder)**.
- Integrate **attention mechanisms** for sequence modeling if using sequence-based recognition (e.g., CRNN, Vision Transformer with CTC).
- Implement **positional encodings and sequence models** if dealing with variable-length outputs.

---

## Training, Evaluation & Optimization (from @character-recognition-system.md)
- Use **mixed precision training (`torch.cuda.amp`)**.
- Implement **gradient accumulation**, **gradient clipping**, and **DistributedDataParallel (DDP)** for large-scale training.
- Use **early stopping**, **learning rate schedulers**, and **cross-validation** when appropriate.
- Track experiments using **TensorBoard or Weights & Biases (wandb)**.
- Use **OCR-specific metrics** (e.g., accuracy, CER, WER, Top-K accuracy).

---

## Deployment & Visualization (from @character-recognition-system.md)
- Build **Gradio interfaces** for **interactive handwritten character recognition demos**, showcasing real-time inference.
- Implement **proper input validation, error handling, and visualization of predictions and attention maps**.

---

## Debugging & Error Handling (from @character-recognition-system.md)
- Use **try-except blocks** in **data loading, preprocessing, and inference**.
- Leverage **PyTorch's debugging tools (`autograd.detect_anomaly()`)**.
- Implement **logging and checkpointing**, ensuring recoverability from interruptions or errors.

---

## Performance Optimization (from @character-recognition-system.md)
- Profile bottlenecks in **data pipelines, I/O, and training loops**.
- Use **torch.utils.benchmark** or **PyTorch Profiler** for detailed performance analysis.
- Optimize **data loading with prefetching, caching, and pinned memory**.

## Dependencies (from @character-recognition-system.md)
```bash
torch
torchvision
transformers
diffusers
gradio
numpy
tqdm
tensorboard
wandb
```

## Conventions & Project Structure (from @character-recognition-system.md)
1. Start with **clear problem definition and dataset exploration**.
2. Maintain **modular code structure**, with separate files for models, data, training, and evaluation.
   - Source code should be placed in a `src/` directory.
   - Tests should be placed in a `tests/` directory.
3. Use **YAML configuration files** for hyperparameters and model settings.
4. Implement **version control (git)** and follow **semantic commit conventions**.
5. Reference **official PyTorch, Transformers, Diffusers, and Gradio documentation** for latest APIs and best practices.
