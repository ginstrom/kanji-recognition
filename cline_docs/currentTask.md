## Current Objective
✅ Fix error in datasplit.py related to character_counts metadata

## Context
The datasplit.py script was failing with an error: `Error during dataset splitting: 'character_counts'`. The issue was that the script was looking for a 'character_counts' key in the metadata, but the actual metadata had the character counts stored under 'character_counts_etl9g' instead.

## Implementation Completed
1. ✅ Identified the issue in the `collect_character_statistics` function where it was trying to access `metadata['character_counts']`
2. ✅ Modified the function to check for different character count keys:
   - First checks for 'character_counts'
   - Then checks for 'character_counts_etl9g'
   - Falls back to an empty dict if neither is found
3. ✅ Tested the fix by running the script, which now completes successfully
4. ✅ Verified that the script correctly creates train, validation, and test LMDB databases

## Previous Objective (Completed)
✅ Write unit tests for src/datasplit.py

## Previous Implementation Completed
1. ✅ Created a new test file `tests/test_datasplit.py`
2. ✅ Implemented test classes for each major function in datasplit.py:
   - `TestParseArgs`: Tests for argument parsing and validation
   - `TestCollectCharacterStatistics`: Tests for character statistics collection
   - `TestAssignSplits`: Tests for stratified splitting of data
   - `TestCreateTargetLmdbs`: Tests for creation of target LMDB databases
   - `TestMain`: Tests for the overall workflow
3. ✅ Used existing fixtures from conftest.py where applicable
4. ✅ Created new fixtures specific to datasplit.py testing:
   - `mock_char_to_keys`: Mock character-to-keys mapping
   - `mock_split_stats`: Mock split statistics
   - `mock_metadata`: Mock metadata
   - `mock_source_env`: Mock source LMDB environment
5. ✅ Used mocking to isolate components and avoid external dependencies
6. ✅ Ensured tests cover both normal operation and error handling
7. ✅ Verified all tests pass successfully

## Next Steps
1. Implement the kanji recognition model
2. Create a PyTorch Dataset class in a separate load.py file to load data from the LMDB databases
3. Develop a training pipeline for the kanji recognition model
