## Current Objective
Implement the kanji recognition model

## Context
Now that we have successfully created the PyTorch Dataset class to load data from the LMDB databases, we can proceed with implementing the kanji recognition model. This will involve designing and implementing a deep learning model architecture suitable for recognizing handwritten kanji characters.

## Implementation Plan
1. Research and select appropriate model architectures for handwritten character recognition
2. Implement the selected model architecture in PyTorch
3. Create a training script with appropriate loss functions and optimizers
4. Implement evaluation metrics for model performance
5. Add support for model checkpointing and early stopping
6. Implement visualization utilities for model predictions

## Previous Objective (Completed)
✅ Create a PyTorch Dataset class in a separate load.py file to load data from the LMDB databases

## Previous Implementation Completed
1. ✅ Created a new src/load.py module with a KanjiLMDBDataset class that:
   - Loads data from LMDB databases
   - Handles deserialization of (image_bytes, label_bytes) tuples
   - Supports image transformations for data augmentation
   - Properly manages LMDB environment resources
2. ✅ Implemented helper functions to:
   - Create DataLoader instances for train/val/test sets
   - Provide utility functions for common transformations
3. ✅ Added robust error handling for LMDB operations
4. ✅ Implemented performance optimizations for efficient data loading:
   - Optional caching of frequently accessed samples
   - Configurable number of worker processes
   - Support for pinned memory in GPU training
5. ✅ Added visualization utilities for dataset inspection
6. ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests for the load.py module
7. ✅ Updated documentation to reflect the new functionality

## Previous Objective (Completed)
✅ Update documentation to reflect changes to datasplit.py

## Previous Implementation Completed
1. ✅ Updated README.md to include information about the datasplit.py script and its functionality:
   - Added a new "Data Processing Pipeline" section
   - Included details about the three main steps: parsing, preparation, and dataset splitting
   - Added information about the optional arguments for datasplit.py
   - Provided an example of how to use custom split ratios
2. ✅ Updated docs/data.md to include information about the dataset splitting process:
   - Added a new "Data Processing Pipeline" section
   - Included details about each step in the pipeline (parsing, preparation, and dataset splitting)
   - Added information about the resulting LMDB databases and their locations
   - Explained the format of the data in the split databases

## Previous Objective (Completed)
✅ Fix error in datasplit.py related to character_counts metadata

## Previous Implementation Completed
1. ✅ Identified the issue in the `collect_character_statistics` function where it was trying to access `metadata['character_counts']`
2. ✅ Modified the function to check for different character count keys:
   - First checks for 'character_counts'
   - Then checks for 'character_counts_etl9g'
   - Falls back to an empty dict if neither is found
3. ✅ Tested the fix by running the script, which now completes successfully
4. ✅ Verified that the script correctly creates train, validation, and test LMDB databases

## Next Steps
1. Implement the kanji recognition model
2. Develop a training pipeline for the kanji recognition model
3. Implement evaluation metrics and visualization tools for model performance
