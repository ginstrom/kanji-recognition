## Current Objective
✅ Implement unit tests using pytest for the kanji recognition project.

## Context
The project previously lacked automated tests. Unit tests have been added to help ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and facilitate future development. Tests were implemented for the core functionality in parse_etl9g.py, clean.py, and prepare.py.

## Implementation Completed
1. ✅ Created a tests directory structure
2. ✅ Implemented test files for each module:
   - tests/test_parse_etl9g.py - Tests for ETL9G parsing functions
   - tests/test_clean.py - Tests for image processing functions
   - tests/test_prepare.py - Tests for LMDB storage and ETL pipeline
   - tests/conftest.py - Shared pytest fixtures
3. ✅ Added pytest and related packages to requirements.txt
4. ✅ Ensured tests can run in the Docker environment
5. ✅ Added documentation for the testing approach in tests/README.md

## Next Steps
1. Implement the kanji recognition model
2. Create tests for the model implementation
3. Develop a user interface for kanji recognition
