## Current Objective
Modify `src/parse_sample.py` to pad images to 128x128 dimensions.

## Context
This task is part of the "Improve image processing pipeline" goal from projectRoadmap.md. Currently, the images are 127x128 pixels, and we need to standardize them to 128x128 for better compatibility with machine learning models.

## Implementation Plan
1. Update the image array initialization in `extract_item9g_image()` function to use 128x128 dimensions
2. Modify the pixel assignment logic to handle the new dimensions correctly
3. Ensure the `crop_and_pad()` function works with the new dimensions

## Next Steps
1. Test the modified code to ensure it correctly processes and saves 128x128 images
2. Continue with other improvements to the image processing pipeline as outlined in the project roadmap
