## Current Objective
Update project documentation and roadmap to focus on touch/stylus input optimization

## Context
We've identified several improvements for our handwritten kanji recognition system, particularly optimizing for touch/stylus input which will be the primary use case. The system needs to be refined to focus on black and white (binary) image processing rather than grayscale preservation, with specific enhancements to our B&W conversion algorithm.

## Implementation Plan
1. Revise the data processing pipeline documentation to explicitly mention optimization for touch/stylus input
2. Update the B&W conversion algorithm section to include the recommended multi-approach method
3. Add a new section on touch input preprocessing for deployment
4. Revise the training approach to emphasize training with B&W images matching our expected inference conditions
5. Reprioritize the roadmap to focus on these optimizations
6. Create a section on testing with real touch/stylus input

## Implementation Details
1. Updated B&W Conversion Algorithm:
   - Document the new `convert_to_bw_multi_approach()` function which:
     - Uses multiple thresholding methods (Otsu, adaptive, and fixed)
     - Selects the best method based on appropriate stroke density for kanji
     - Applies morphological operations to improve stroke connectivity
     - Is optimized for touch/stylus input characteristics

2. Training Approach Updates:
   - Focus on training with B&W rather than grayscale to match deployment conditions
   - Augmentation should simulate realistic touch input variations (stroke thickness, jitter)
   - Preprocessing should standardize inputs to improve generalization

3. Touch Input Processing for Deployment:
   - Preprocessing pipeline for real-time input from touch/stylus
   - Standardizing input size and stroke characteristics
   - Real-time processing performance considerations

4. Testing Strategy:
   - Methods for evaluating model performance with realistic touch input
   - Comparison metrics between different preprocessing approaches
   - User experience testing considerations
