## Current Objective
✅ Update documentation to reflect changes to datasplit.py

## Context
The datasplit.py script was recently fixed to handle different character count keys in metadata ('character_counts' vs 'character_counts_etl9g'). The documentation needed to be updated to reflect these changes and to provide more information about the dataset splitting process.

## Implementation Completed
1. ✅ Updated README.md to include information about the datasplit.py script and its functionality:
   - Added a new "Data Processing Pipeline" section
   - Included details about the three main steps: parsing, preparation, and dataset splitting
   - Added information about the optional arguments for datasplit.py
   - Provided an example of how to use custom split ratios
2. ✅ Updated docs/data.md to include information about the dataset splitting process:
   - Added a new "Data Processing Pipeline" section
   - Included details about each step in the pipeline (parsing, preparation, and dataset splitting)
   - Added information about the resulting LMDB databases and their locations
   - Explained the format of the data in the split databases

## Previous Objective (Completed)
✅ Fix error in datasplit.py related to character_counts metadata

## Previous Implementation Completed
1. ✅ Identified the issue in the `collect_character_statistics` function where it was trying to access `metadata['character_counts']`
2. ✅ Modified the function to check for different character count keys:
   - First checks for 'character_counts'
   - Then checks for 'character_counts_etl9g'
   - Falls back to an empty dict if neither is found
3. ✅ Tested the fix by running the script, which now completes successfully
4. ✅ Verified that the script correctly creates train, validation, and test LMDB databases

## Next Steps
1. Implement the kanji recognition model
2. Create a PyTorch Dataset class in a separate load.py file to load data from the LMDB databases
3. Develop a training pipeline for the kanji recognition model
