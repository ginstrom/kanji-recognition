## Current Objective
Implement a simple kanji recognition model and training pipeline

## Context
Now that we have successfully created the PyTorch Dataset class to load data from the LMDB databases, we can proceed with implementing the kanji recognition model. We'll start with a simple CNN model and basic training pipeline to establish a working baseline, which we can later enhance with more advanced features.

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement a simple CNN model architecture in PyTorch with:
   - Two convolutional layers with max pooling
   - One fully connected layer for classification
2. Create a basic training script with:
   - Standard cross-entropy loss
   - Adam optimizer with default parameters
   - Simple training and validation loops
3. Implement basic evaluation metrics (accuracy)
4. Add support for saving the final model

## Previous Objective (Completed)
✅ Create a PyTorch Dataset class in a separate load.py file to load data from the LMDB databases

## Previous Implementation Completed
1. ✅ Created a new src/load.py module with a KanjiLMDBDataset class that:
   - Loads data from LMDB databases
   - Handles deserialization of (image_bytes, label_bytes) tuples
   - Supports image transformations for data augmentation
   - Properly manages LMDB environment resources
2. ✅ Implemented helper functions to:
   - Create DataLoader instances for train/val/test sets
   - Provide utility functions for common transformations
3. ✅ Added robust error handling for LMDB operations
4. ✅ Implemented performance optimizations for efficient data loading:
   - Optional caching of frequently accessed samples
   - Configurable number of worker processes
   - Support for pinned memory in GPU training
5. ✅ Added visualization utilities for dataset inspection
6. ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests for the load.py module
7. ✅ Updated documentation to reflect the new functionality

## Previous Objective (Completed)
✅ Update documentation to reflect changes to datasplit.py

## Previous Implementation Completed
1. ✅ Updated README.md to include information about the datasplit.py script and its functionality:
   - Added a new "Data Processing Pipeline" section
   - Included details about the three main steps: parsing, preparation, and dataset splitting
   - Added information about the optional arguments for datasplit.py
   - Provided an example of how to use custom split ratios
2. ✅ Updated docs/data.md to include information about the dataset splitting process:
   - Added a new "Data Processing Pipeline" section
   - Included details about each step in the pipeline (parsing, preparation, and dataset splitting)
   - Added information about the resulting LMDB databases and their locations
   - Explained the format of the data in the split databases

## Previous Objective (Completed)
✅ Fix error in datasplit.py related to character_counts metadata

## Previous Implementation Completed
1. ✅ Identified the issue in the `collect_character_statistics` function where it was trying to access `metadata['character_counts']`
2. ✅ Modified the function to check for different character count keys:
   - First checks for 'character_counts'
   - Then checks for 'character_counts_etl9g'
   - Falls back to an empty dict if neither is found
3. ✅ Tested the fix by running the script, which now completes successfully
4. ✅ Verified that the script correctly creates train, validation, and test LMDB databases

## Next Steps
1. Implement the kanji recognition model
2. Develop a training pipeline for the kanji recognition model
3. Implement evaluation metrics and visualization tools for model performance
