## Current Objective
✅ Create a "make test" command that runs unit tests in the Docker Compose environment.

## Context
The project has unit tests implemented using pytest, but there was no dedicated Makefile target for running tests. Previously, tests were run using `make run python -m pytest`. Adding a dedicated "make test" command simplifies the testing process.

## Implementation Completed
1. ✅ Added a new target to the Makefile for running tests
2. ✅ Updated the tests/README.md documentation to include the new command
3. ✅ Updated the techStack.md to include the new command in the Development Workflow section
4. ✅ Updated the codebaseSummary.md with the new test command information
5. ✅ Updated the README.md with the new test command information
6. ✅ Added the new command to the projectRoadmap.md as a completed task

## Previous Objective (Completed)
✅ Implement unit tests using pytest for the kanji recognition project.

## Previous Implementation Completed
1. ✅ Created a tests directory structure
2. ✅ Implemented test files for each module:
   - tests/test_parse_etl9g.py - Tests for ETL9G parsing functions
   - tests/test_clean.py - Tests for image processing functions
   - tests/test_prepare.py - Tests for LMDB storage and ETL pipeline
   - tests/conftest.py - Shared pytest fixtures
3. ✅ Added pytest and related packages to requirements.txt
4. ✅ Ensured tests can run in the Docker environment
5. ✅ Added documentation for the testing approach in tests/README.md

## Next Steps
1. Implement the kanji recognition model
2. Create tests for the model implementation
3. Develop a user interface for kanji recognition
